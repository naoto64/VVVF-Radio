## How to use
Connect earphones to the audio output terminal. When listening to sound, please be careful about the volume so as not to damage your ears. If your IC recorder has a line input terminal, connect an audio cable (with 3.5mm mini plugs on both ends, sold separately).

## Note
It cannot be connected to a microphone terminal or a smartphone.

The device is designed to turn on when the plug is connected to the line output terminal. Therefore, please note that leaving the cable connected will cause the battery to drain faster.

The front panel is made by a 3D printer, so the surface roughness may be noticeable.
